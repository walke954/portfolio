# About

Originally from the great and beautiful state of Minnesota, I gathered my belongings in the summer of 2017 and migrated to my current city of Phoenix, AZ. While transitioning to my new life in the desert, I discovered a newfound love of web development and computer programming, which quickly led me to enroll in a web development bootcamp. I have since developed a deep admiration for air conditioning, cactuses (cacti?), and dodgerblue.
